KELLY:
- we should add a response class pointer in fd_data structure
- we should add a booleen in response class wich say response is ready or not
- when the client fd is pollout, we can send it the response if it's ready.
- make a fonction which stop everything, if it's not allready done.

	=> do we make a map<fd, request class> directly ?

What to discuss
